\section*{Abstract}
Modern real-time systems face significant challenges in ensuring that tasks meet their deadlines, primarily due to the unpredictability of \ac{WCET}. 
Accurate timing analysis is crucial for the validation of these systems, but it is often hindered by the complexity and variability of real-world applications. 
Benchmarks play a vital role in this context, providing a standardized way to evaluate and validate timing analysis techniques. 
This thesis explores the development of a generator for benchmarks, aimed at creating diverse and representative test cases that can be used to rigorously assess the performance and reliability of timing analysis methods in real-time systems.
