	abstract = {Implementation-based benchmarking of timing and schedulability analyses requires system code that can be executed on real hardware and has deﬁned properties, for example, known worst-case execution times (WCETs) of tasks. Traditional approaches for creating benchmarks with such characteristics often result in implementations that do not resemble real-world systems, either due to work only being simulated by means of busy waiting, or because tasks have no controlﬂow dependencies between each other. In this paper, we address this problem with TASKers, a generator that constructs realistic benchmark systems with predeﬁned properties. To achieve this, TASKers composes patterns of real-world programs to generate tasks that produce known outputs and exhibit preconﬁgured WCETs when being executed with certain inputs. Using this knowledge during the generation process, TASKers is able to speciﬁcally introduce inter-task control-ﬂow dependencies by mapping the output of one task to the input of another.},
